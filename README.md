GlkOte-term
========

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/curiousdannii/glkote-term.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is terminal implementation of the [GlkOte](https://github.com/erkyrath/glkote) library. At the moment only a stdio (DumbGlkOte) implementation is available: it allows only one window to be created, and is broadly compatible with the C [Cheapglk](https://github.com/erkyrath/cheapglk) library. In the future a multi-window implementation will be developed. GlkOte-term includes glkapi.js and a version of the Dialog library.

For sample code, see [tests/zvm.js](https://github.com/curiousdannii/glkote-term/blob/master/tests/zvm.js).
